Repository for User Files

.list files for TravelMapping users are stored here, and are retrieved from here for site updates.

TM users are welcome to update their own lists by submitting pull requests through to this repository or to submit list file updates by email to travmap@teresco.org to be placed here by the site admins.  Please note that user list files in the repository must be in plain text format, be placed in the `list_files` directory, and have a `.list` extention to be successfully read by TM's site update process.  Emailed submissions with different or extra extensions (Windows and MacOS plain text editors often silently add a `.txt` extension) can be corrected by the admins while moving the files into place in the repository, but those who submit directly to the repository need to take care to get all of this correct.

See https://travelmapping.net and https://forum.travelmapping.net/ for more information about Travel Mapping.
