#I'm so excited to have discovered this site. 
#TravelMapping.net is the computer version of my atlas + stats spreadsheet. 
#My atlas + spreadsheet is still my ultimate source of truth, but this allows me to visualize travels on a more malleable map and gives me stats I wouldn't have thought of.  It also provides a check for me. 

#My focus is on interstates and US highways.  Those are what I track in my stats spreadsheet.
#Yes, I highlight state routes on my atlas.  And yes, sometimes I'll enter those into the site. But those aren't my focus. 

#Project started on Oct 21, 2022 as Mom and I began our drive to Cincy. 

#Generally entering info by state, with the most major highways listed first. 

#As far as concurrencies go, I'm going to enter routes based on the main road I was intending to follow. Save myself some data lines and let the site grab the concurrency. 
#For example, in the I-70 mountain corridor, I have listed both I-70 and US 40. 
#Even though I-70 leads the concurrency, I drove from WP to the Wooly Mammoth lot trying to follow US 40. 
#If US 40 is rerouted in the future, I still want credit for it. I drove it as it existed at the time! 

#In general, if I didn't make it to the next waypoint, I'm not going to include that section.  It should be noted in my spreadsheet where my endpoint is.
