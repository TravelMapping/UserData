#As far as concurrencies go, I'm going to enter routes based on the main road I was intending to follow.  
#For example, in the mountain corridor, I have listed both I-70 and US 40. 
#Even though I-70 leads the concurrency, I drove from WP to Wooly Mammoth trying to follow US 40. 
#If US 40 is rerouted in the future, I think I still want credit for it. I drove it as it existed at the time!

#I've actually driven south to CR 140, but there's not a waypoint there and I don't want to overexaggerate.
