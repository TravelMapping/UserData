#Welcome to The_Ginger's Clinched Highways!
#My personal defintion of a clinch is:
#A road segment is marked traveled (clinched) if I, "The_Ginger," experience—by use of the eyes—said road segment in at least one posted cardinal direction.

#All roads are organzed by type, then number in ascending order.
